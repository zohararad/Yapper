# Yapper
## HTML5 WebSockets and Server-Side Events Demo

This node application is purely for demonstration purposes. Going through the code you can see basic usage of both WebSockets (client and server) and Server-Side Events.

Due to chosen Node.js WebSockets library, Yapper does not work with Safari
